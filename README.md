The Inventory Management System plays a critical role in ensuring quality control for businesses handling consumer goods by automatically tracking stock levels and transactions. For example, in a large retail store, without proper inventory control, essential items may run out without timely reordering. This system not only tracks significant shipments—detecting errors like missing items—but also reduces manual counting errors, especially with large quantities. Additionally, it helps monitor theft, track sales, and improve overall business efficiency by providing real-time inventory updates, helping store owners make informed decisions on when and how much to reorder.

In this project, a responsive frontend was built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and PHP, ensuring smooth and intuitive user interaction for managing inventory. The backend was developed using Flask and integrated with Oracle Database to handle the data efficiently, enabling automated tracking of stock, sales, and reorders, ultimately reducing paperwork, human errors, and manual delays. This system helps streamline the inventory process, improving both operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.
